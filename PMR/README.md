## Comparing anthropological theories

* Tools: LaTeX with TikZ
* Challenge: How to visually compare two theories?

#### Background

In the post-marital residence research, aside of multiple factors, there are two primary theories that describe post-marital residence change. The Ember's Warfare Theory of Matrilocality, and the Divale's Migration Theory of Matrilocality. To be able to model them, one needs to understand them, but to be able to easily communicate their importance to unfamiliar audience, a visualization is required.

#### Challenge
Both theories share similarities, yet they are presented differently. While Ember's theory describes purely a functional effect of processes (such as presence or absence of internal warfare), Divale's theory describe a time-progression and the evolution of post-marital residence in a society. To visualize the differences, as well as the functional and time-progression, I chose simple charts, with factors or events represented as nodes. The residence is also colour-coded, with blue representing patrilocal residence, while red being matrilocal.

In Ember's theory, residence starts indetermined, and is determined only when the warfare or type of labour are specified. Under the Divale's theory, the chart represents a time-progression, starting from a patrilocal society, which migrates and is forced to adapt to a new environment ripe with warfare.

Using these charts, the differences and similarities between both theories can be seen clearly. A unified theory can then be created and tested using simulations (see the agent-based model described elsewhere).
